Two Assembly Programs From An Assignment In CS205 Systems Programming and Architecture

| Assignment Question |
Digits is an assembly program has a defined quad word integer variable named input in the initialized data section between 0 and 1000. Additionally, as output the program will have three quad word integer variables named ones, tens, hundreds in the uninitialized
data section (bss), and calculates the decimal representation of input, by putting the ones place in ones and so on.

Height is an assembly program that . The program has an input defined as a double-precision floating-point variable named velocity in the initilized data section. The program has an output defined as a double-point precision floating-point variable named height
in the initialized data section (bss). Lastly, the program has a .section .rodata filled with constants to change the constant g from the equation Height = 1/2 * velocity^2/g
